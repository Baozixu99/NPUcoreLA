Command parameters:
.IP "\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename"
is a disk image filename
.IP "\fIfmt\fR" 4
.IX Item "fmt"
is the disk image format. It is guessed automatically in most cases. See below
for a description of the supported disk formats.
.IP "\fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "size"
is the disk image size in bytes. Optional suffixes \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`K\*(C'\fR
(kilobyte, 1024) \f(CW\*(C`M\*(C'\fR (megabyte, 1024k) and \f(CW\*(C`G\*(C'\fR (gigabyte, 1024M)
and T (terabyte, 1024G) are supported.  \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR is ignored.
.IP "\fIoutput_filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "output_filename"
is the destination disk image filename
.IP "\fIoutput_fmt\fR" 4
.IX Item "output_fmt"
is the destination format
.IP "\fIoptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "options"
is a comma separated list of format specific options in a
name=value format. Use \f(CW\*(C`\-o ?\*(C'\fR for an overview of the options supported
by the used format or see the format descriptions below for details.
.IP "\fIsnapshot_param\fR" 4
.IX Item "snapshot_param"
is param used for internal snapshot, format is
\&'snapshot.id=[\s-1ID\s0],snapshot.name=[\s-1NAME\s0]' or '[\s-1ID_OR_NAME\s0]'
.IP "\fB\-\-object\fR \fIobjectdef\fR" 4
.IX Item "--object objectdef"
is a \s-1QEMU\s0 user creatable object definition. See the \f(CWqemu(1)\fR manual
page for a description of the object properties. The most common object
type is a \f(CW\*(C`secret\*(C'\fR, which is used to supply passwords and/or encryption
keys.
.IP "\fB\-\-image\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "--image-opts"
Indicates that the source \fIfilename\fR parameter is to be interpreted as a
full option string, not a plain filename. This parameter is mutually
exclusive with the \fI\-f\fR parameter.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-image\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-image-opts"
Indicates that the \fIoutput_filename\fR parameter(s) are to be interpreted as
a full option string, not a plain filename. This parameter is mutually
exclusive with the \fI\-O\fR parameters. It is currently required to also use
the \fI\-n\fR parameter to skip image creation. This restriction may be relaxed
in a future release.
.IP "\fB\-\-force\-share (\-U)\fR" 4
.IX Item "--force-share (-U)"
If specified, \f(CW\*(C`qemu\-img\*(C'\fR will open the image in shared mode, allowing
other \s-1QEMU\s0 processes to open it in write mode. For example, this can be used to
get the image information (with 'info' subcommand) when the image is used by a
running guest.  Note that this could produce inconsistent results because of
concurrent metadata changes, etc. This option is only allowed when opening
images in read-only mode.
.IP "\fB\-\-backing\-chain\fR" 4
.IX Item "--backing-chain"
will enumerate information about backing files in a disk image chain. Refer
below for further description.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
indicates that target image must be compressed (qcow format only)
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
with or without a command shows help and lists the supported formats
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
display progress bar (compare, convert and rebase commands only).
If the \fI\-p\fR option is not used for a command that supports it, the
progress is reported when the process receives a \f(CW\*(C`SIGUSR1\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`SIGINFO\*(C'\fR signal.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
Quiet mode \- do not print any output (except errors). There's no progress bar
in case both \fI\-q\fR and \fI\-p\fR options are used.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S size"
indicates the consecutive number of bytes that must contain only zeros
for qemu-img to create a sparse image during conversion. This value is rounded
down to the nearest 512 bytes. You may use the common size suffixes like
\&\f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR for kilobytes.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fIcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t cache"
specifies the cache mode that should be used with the (destination) file. See
the documentation of the emulator's \f(CW\*(C`\-drive cache=...\*(C'\fR option for allowed
values.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fIsrc_cache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T src_cache"
specifies the cache mode that should be used with the source file(s). See
the documentation of the emulator's \f(CW\*(C`\-drive cache=...\*(C'\fR option for allowed
values.
.PP
Parameters to snapshot subcommand:

.PP
Parameters to convert subcommand:
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Skip the creation of the target volume
.IP "\fB\-m\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m"
Number of parallel coroutines for the convert process
.IP "\fB\-W\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W"
Allow out-of-order writes to the destination. This option improves performance,
but is only recommended for preallocated devices like host devices or other
raw block devices.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
Try to use copy offloading to move data from source image to target. This may
improve performance if the data is remote, such as with \s-1NFS\s0 or iSCSI backends,
but will not automatically sparsify zero sectors, and may result in a fully
allocated target image depending on the host support for getting allocation
information.

Run a simple sequential I/O benchmark on the specified image. If \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR is
specified, a write test is performed, otherwise a read test is performed.
.Sp
A total number of \fIcount\fR I/O requests is performed, each \fIbuffer_size\fR
bytes in size, and with \fIdepth\fR requests in parallel. The first request
starts at the position given by \fIoffset\fR, each following request increases
the current position by \fIstep_size\fR. If \fIstep_size\fR is not given,
\&\fIbuffer_size\fR is used for its value.
.Sp
If \fIflush_interval\fR is specified for a write test, the request queue is
drained and a flush is issued before new writes are made whenever the number of
remaining requests is a multiple of \fIflush_interval\fR. If additionally
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-drain\*(C'\fR is specified, a flush is issued without draining the request
queue first.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR is specified, the native \s-1AIO\s0 backend is used if possible. On
Linux, this option only works if \f(CW\*(C`\-t none\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-t directsync\*(C'\fR is
specified as well.
.Sp
For write tests, by default a buffer filled with zeros is written. This can be
overridden with a pattern byte specified by \fIpattern\fR.
.IP "\fBcheck [\-\-object\fR \fIobjectdef\fR\fB] [\-\-image\-opts] [\-q] [\-f\fR \fIfmt\fR\fB] [\-\-output=\fR\fIofmt\fR\fB] [\-r [leaks | all]] [\-T\fR \fIsrc_cache\fR\fB] [\-U]\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "check [--object objectdef] [--image-opts] [-q] [-f fmt] [--output=ofmt] [-r [leaks | all]] [-T src_cache] [-U] filename"
Perform a consistency check on the disk image \fIfilename\fR. The command can
output in the format \fIofmt\fR which is either \f(CW\*(C`human\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`json\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR is specified, qemu-img tries to repair any inconsistencies found
during the check. \f(CW\*(C`\-r leaks\*(C'\fR repairs only cluster leaks, whereas
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-r all\*(C'\fR fixes all kinds of errors, with a higher risk of choosing the
wrong fix or hiding corruption that has already occurred.
.Sp
Only the formats \f(CW\*(C`qcow2\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`qed\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vdi\*(C'\fR support
consistency checks.
.Sp
In case the image does not have any inconsistencies, check exits with \f(CW0\fR.
Other exit codes indicate the kind of inconsistency found or if another error
occurred. The following table summarizes all exit codes of the check subcommand:
.RS 4

If \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR is specified, exit codes representing the image state refer to the

Commit the changes recorded in \fIfilename\fR in its base image or backing file.
If the backing file is smaller than the snapshot, then the backing file will be
resized to be the same size as the snapshot.  If the snapshot is smaller than
the backing file, the backing file will not be truncated.  If you want the

If the backing chain of the given image file \fIfilename\fR has more than one
layer, the backing file into which the changes will be committed may be
specified as \fIbase\fR (which has to be part of \fIfilename\fR's backing
chain). If \fIbase\fR is not specified, the immediate backing file of the top
image (which is \fIfilename\fR) will be used. Note that after a commit operation
all images between \fIbase\fR and the top image will be invalid and may return
garbage data when read. For this reason, \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR implies \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR (so that

By default, images with different size are considered identical if the larger
image contains only unallocated and/or zeroed sectors in the area after the end
of the other image. In addition, if any sector is not allocated in one image

Only the formats \f(CW\*(C`qcow\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`qcow2\*(C'\fR support compression. The
compression is read-only. It means that if a compressed sector is
rewritten, then it is rewritten as uncompressed data.

The use of encryption in qcow and qcow2 images is considered to be flawed by
modern cryptography standards, suffering from a number of design problems:
.RS 4
.IP "\-" 4
The AES-CBC cipher is used with predictable initialization vectors based
on the sector number. This makes it vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks
which can reveal the existence of encrypted data.
.IP "\-" 4
The user passphrase is directly used as the encryption key. A poorly
chosen or short passphrase will compromise the security of the encryption.
.IP "\-" 4
In the event of the passphrase being compromised there is no way to
change the passphrase to protect data in any qcow images. The files must
be cloned, using a different encryption passphrase in the new file. The
original file must then be securely erased using a program like shred,
though even this is ineffective with many modern storage technologies.
.IP "\-" 4
Initialization vectors used to encrypt sectors are based on the
guest virtual sector number, instead of the host physical sector. When
a disk image has multiple internal snapshots this means that data in
multiple physical sectors is encrypted with the same initialization
vector. With the \s-1CBC\s0 mode, this opens the possibility of watermarking
attacks if the attack can collect multiple sectors encrypted with the
same \s-1IV\s0 and some predictable data. Having multiple qcow2 images with
the same passphrase also exposes this weakness since the passphrase
is directly used as the key.

tables must be rebuilt, i.e. on the next open an (automatic) \f(CW\*(C`qemu\-img
check \-r all\*(C'\fR is required, which may take some time.

This option can only be enabled if \f(CW\*(C`compat=1.1\*(C'\fR is specified.

If this option is set to \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR, it will turn off \s-1COW\s0 of the file. It's only
valid on btrfs, no effect on other file systems.
.Sp
Btrfs has low performance when hosting a \s-1VM\s0 image file, even more when the guest
on the \s-1VM\s0 also using btrfs as file system. Turning off \s-1COW\s0 is a way to mitigate
this bad performance. Generally there are two ways to turn off \s-1COW\s0 on btrfs:
a) Disable it by mounting with nodatacow, then all newly created files will be
\&\s-1NOCOW.\s0 b) For an empty file, add the \s-1NOCOW\s0 file attribute. That's what this option
does.
.Sp
Note: this option is only valid to new or empty files. If there is an existing
file which is \s-1COW\s0 and has data blocks already, it couldn't be changed to \s-1NOCOW\s0
by setting \f(CW\*(C`nocow=on\*(C'\fR. One can issue \f(CW\*(C`lsattr filename\*(C'\fR to check if
the \s-1NOCOW\s0 flag is set or not (Capital 'C' is \s-1NOCOW\s0 flag).

\&\s-1QEMU\s0 also supports various other image file formats for compatibility with
older \s-1QEMU\s0 versions or other hypervisors, including \s-1VMDK, VDI, VHD\s0 (vpc), \s-1VHDX,\s0
qcow1 and \s-1QED.\s0 For a full list of supported formats see \f(CW\*(C`qemu\-img \-\-help\*(C'\fR.
For a more detailed description of these formats, see the \s-1QEMU\s0 Emulation User
Documentation.
.Sp
The main purpose of the block drivers for these formats is image conversion.
For running VMs, it is recommended to convert the disk images to either raw or
qcow2 in order to achieve good performance.
